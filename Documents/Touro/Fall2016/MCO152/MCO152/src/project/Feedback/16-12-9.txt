This is a good start but it still needs a lot of work. I got a simple runtime error just from entering unexpected input, you should validate all input. Also, I know this is a relatively short-term project but try to add just a little more testing.

Try to pick up the pace a bit and get some more functionality in. Keep up the good work.
